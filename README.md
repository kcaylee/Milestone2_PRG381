For this milestone, we developed a Java Library Management System as a desktop application. This project focuses on managing a library's book inventory and borrowing transactions, with the following core requirements:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built using Java Swing to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Programming Concepts: Utilized Core Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to structure and organize the application.

Database Operations (CRUD): Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities using a JavaDB database to manage library records and transactions efficiently.


This project highlights the integration of Java Swing for the front-end and JavaDB for data storage, showcasing key software development practices in Java for building functional desktop applications.
